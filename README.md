Predicting Breast Cancer Survival with Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Guide Using Python

This project implements a machine learning model to predict breast cancer survival using patient data. The model utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a dataset of over 400 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery. This dataset can be found on Kaggle.
